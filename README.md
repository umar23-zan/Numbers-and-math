# Numbers-and-math
In this section we are going to practicing the numbers and math in javascript.
a) At a restaurant, you order 1 soup for $10, 3 burgers for $8 each, and 1 ice cream for $5. Use JavaScript to calculate the cost of the order.
```
1*10+3*8+1*5
```
b) You're at a restaurant with 2 friends (3 people in total) and make the same order as 2a. Calculate how much each person pays.
```
3*(1*10+3*8+1*5)
```
c) Calculate the total cost of a toaster ($18.50) and 2 shirts ($7.50 each).
```
1850+2*750
3350/100
```
d) Calculate a 10% tax for the total in exercise 2c.
```
33.50*0.1
```
e) Calculate a 20% tax for the total in 2c.
```
33.50*0.2
```
f) Calculate the cost of the products (before shipping and taxes). 
```
(1899+2095+799)/100
```
g) Calculate the Total before tax.
```
((1899+2095+799)+499)/100
```
h) Calculate the 10% tax exactly.
```
52.92*0.1
```
i) Calculate Order total at the bottom.
```
52.92+52.92*0.1
```
